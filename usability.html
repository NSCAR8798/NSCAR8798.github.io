        <h1>Usability Page</h1>
        
        <h2>Language</h2>
            <p>
                • The language was not identified for all of the documents in my portfolio.<br><br>
                Identifying the language of the page allows screen readers to read the content in the appropriate language. It also facilitates automatic translation of content.
            </p><br>
        
        <h2>Headings</h2>
            <p>
                • The "What I Enjoy" page of my portfolio did not have a proper first level heading so I changed it to do so.<br><br>
                Headings facilitate page navigation for users of many assistive technologies. They also provide semantic and visual meaning and structure to the document. A first level heading should be present on nearly all pages. It should contain the most important heading on the page (generally the document title).<br><br>
                • On the "What I Enjoy" and javascript page of my portfolio, a heading level was skipped. That meant that I had gone straight from a first level heading to a third level heading without using a second level heading in between. I was able to fix this by changing all the third level headings to second level headings.<br><br>
                Headings provide document structure and facilitate keyboard navigation by users of assistive technology. These users may be confused or experience difficulty navigating when heading levels are skipped.
            </p><br>
        
        <h2>Labeling</h2>
            <p>
                • In the javascript page of my portfolio, there were form controls that did not have a corresponding label.<br><br>
                If a form control does not have a properly associated text label, the function or purpose of that form control may not be presented to screen reader users. Form labels also provide visible descriptions and larger clickable targets for form controls.
            </p><br>
        
        <h2>Colors and Contrast</h2>
            <p>
                • On all of the documents in my portfolio, the navigation bar was originally green. I felt like that color did not contrast with the text very well so I changed it to white. I then changed the hover text on the navigation bar to green so it was easier to tell when hovering over a link. Lastly, I added a black bottom border to the navigation bar to make it easier to tell the difference between the navigation bar and the page itself.
            </p>
        
        <h2>Still Improving...</h2>
            <p>
                • I am still trying to improve as best as I can to make my portfolio look as good as possible in the future. I hope the steps I just took made the site better and more accessible to as many users as possible. I know I can stil improve and want my portfolio to look as good as possible for the future.
