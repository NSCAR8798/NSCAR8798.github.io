<h1>Nick Scardina Fields Report</h1>

        <p>&emsp;&emsp;To make it somewhat short, there is a bigger difference between computer science, software engineering, and information technology than you might think. Computer scientists design and develop computer programs, software, and applications. Information technology professionals then use and troubleshoot those programs, software, and applications. Computer scientists, software engineers, and information technology professionals all work together to make sure hardware, software, and user interface come together smoothly so that computers can carry out the tasks businesses and individuals need from them. Although these three professions may sound similar, they each do different things.<br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;There are many different fields of computer science, but in this report, I will just through a few of them. The three I will go over are hardware, networking, and graphics. The hardware field of computer science deals with building circuits and chips. Hardware design lies in the center of engineering and covers topics like chip architecture, but also more general electrical engineering-style circuit design. The networking field of computer science covers topics dealing with device interconnection, and is closely related to systems. Network design deals with anything from laying out a home network to figuring out the best way to link together military installations. The graphics field of computer science has become well-known for work in making amazing animated movies. It also covers topics such as data visualization which make it easier to understand and analyze complex data.<br><br>

        &emsp;&emsp;The field of computer science that I am most interested in is one that I did not go over. That being the field of computer programming. According to www.bls.gov, “Computer programmers write and test code that allows computer applications and software programs to function properly. They turn the program designs created by software developers and engineers into instructions that a computer can follow.” For my major, I am concentrating in computer programming and I enjoy it a lot so far.</p><br>
