        <h2>What I Expect to Learn From This Class</h2>

        <p>Since I am majoring in computer information systems with a focus on computer programming, the thing I want to learn most from this class is how to progroam and write code. Creating this website helped me learn the basics of it and I just want to keep learning it. It really helped me especially because I want a job doing this kind of stuff in the future.</p>
